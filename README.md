# MadLibs
App Studio Project 2

Mad Libs is an app in which the user can make short stories by filling in blank placeholders. 
There are 6 different stories that come with the app. When the "Get started button is pressed on the welcome screen, a 
random story is picked. Then the user is asked to enter a placeholder. Then the user taps "next" the placeholder is filled
into the story but it is not shown yet, and the next placeholder is asked for. Only after all the placeholders are filled in, 
the story will be shown.
